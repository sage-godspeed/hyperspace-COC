                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for participants of a community or project. <br>
                    Like most technical communities as a whole, Our community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from different backgrounds and specializations, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.
                    <br>
                    Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code of conduct applies equally to leaders, mentors, representatives, and learners the same.
                    <br>
                    This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate. <br>
                    This code of conduct applies to all Hyperspace activities and events. This includes the mailing lists, the questions asked, supports given from and to fellow learners, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be patient and friendly -<i> Don’t be a “know it all” </i>.</strong> A great number of us are here to learn from one another. If you feel you are above this, please do well to keep this information to yourself and not intimidate others who just started or are trying to carve a path to a new career.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Introductions.</strong> When starting a new direct message with someone especially mentors, it is of good etiquette to always introduce yourself, say what you do. It helps smoothen the conversation and serves as an Icebreaker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We are striving to be a community the welcomes and supports each other. This includes and is not limited to ethnicity, gender, economic class, educational level, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong> careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: <br>
                    Violent threats or language directed against another person. <br>
                    Discriminatory jokes and language.<br>
                    Posting sexually explicit or violent material. <br>
                    Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").<br>
                    Personal insults, especially those using racist, tribalistic/(xenophobic) or sexist terms.<br>
                    Unwelcome sexual attention and repeated harassment of others.<br>
                    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Spaces.</strong>
                            Please adhere to the purpose of the virtual spaces. No posting of irrelevant content or ads or broadcast messages with no correlation to the community’s activities.
                            </li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Meetups and Events</strong>
                            Although the organizing teams often have everything locked down it's still a kind gesture to help out during the course of community activity. As it helps to reduce the workload for everyone on the team. </li>
                    <li><strong>Event Spaces and Equipment</strong>
                            Dear friend, please use and handle equipment and event spaces for our community activities carefully, sometimes they are given to us in good faith. It would be unfair to leave them damaged or littered/messed up. So always keep these spaces better than you met them, it speaks well of everyone at the end of the day.
                            </li>
